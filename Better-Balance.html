        Barry Peterson is our User Persona that is derived from our research.  We will be using Barry as the standard for all our design decisions moving forward. From here we were able to create a UX Scenario and User Journey Map based on Barry and Better Balance.

                We believe that people with sedentary jobs experience deleterious effects to their health from prolonged sitting and bad posture. This leads to chronic pain that interferes with daily work, which could have been avoided with preventative measures. <br>
                <h6>We may solve this problem by customizing and gammifying usersâ€™ experiences based on the data collected from a strong onboarding and activity feedback, providing targeted plans/routines, and customizable notifications and alarms. </h6><br>
                <h4>
                We will know we have succeeded when we see an increase in new users and user retention, and when the application will receive positive reviews.
